    <h2>Derivatives Basic</h2>
    <h5>The derivative of a function is one of the basic concepts of calculus mathematics. Together with the integral,
      derivative covers the central place in calculus. The process of finding the derivative is differentiation.</h5>

    <h2>Algebra</h2>
    <h5>Algebra is the branch of mathematics concerning the study of the rules of operations and relations, and the
      constructions and concepts arising from them, including terms, polynomials, equations and algebraic structures.
      Together with geometry, analysis, topology, combinatorics, and number theory, algebra is one of the main branches
      of pure mathematics.</h5>

    <h2>Cartesian Coordinate</h2>
    <h5>Artesian coordinates allow one to specify the location of a point in the plane, or in three-dimensional space.
      The Cartesian coordinates (also called rectangular coordinates) of a point are a pair of numbers (in
      two-dimensions) or a triplet of numbers (in three-dimensions) that specified signed distances from the coordinate
      axis.</h5>
    <a href=""><img src="image/courses 3.png" width="100%" alt="Cinque Terre"></a>
    <br>
    <h2>Trigonometry</h2>
    <h5>Trigonometry is a branch of mathematics that studies triangles, particularly right triangles. Trigonometry deals
      with relationships between the sides and the angles of triangles and with the trigonometric functions, which
      describe those relationships, as well as describing angles in general and the motion of waves such as sound and
      light waves.</h5>

    <br>
    <h2>Geometry</h2>
    <h5>Geometry (Ancient Greek: γεωμετρία; geo- "earth", -metria "measurement") "Earth-Measuring" is a part of
      mathematics concerned with questions of size, shape, relative position of figures, and the properties of space.
      Geometry is one of the oldest sciences. Initially a body of practical knowledge concerning lengths, areas, and
      volumes, in the 3rd century BC geometry was put into an axiomatic form by Euclid, whose treatment—Euclidean
      geometry—set a standard for many centuries to follow. The field of astronomy, especially mapping the positions of
      the stars and planets on the celestial sphere, served as an important source of geometric problems during the next
      one and a half millennia. A mathematician who works in the field of geometry is called a geometer.</h5>

    <h2>Complex Number</h2>
    <h5>A complex number is a number comprising a real and imaginary part. It can be written in the form a + bi, where a
      and b are real numbers, and i is the standard imaginary unit with the property i 2 = −1.[1] The complex numbers
      contain the ordinary real numbers, but extend them by adding in extra numbers and correspondingly expanding the
      understanding of addition and multiplication.</h5>
